## JS Example

This package demonstrates how to use TypeScript/JS to interact with your rollup.

### Prerequisites

1.  Install nodejs and a package manager. All commands in this example assume `npm`, but feel free to substitute `yarn` instead. `bun` is not currently supported in this example but will work if you want to use it for your project.
2.  Install dependencies `npm install`
3.  In `crates/rollup` build & run your rollup: `cargo run --bin node`
4.  In this directory run `npm run start`
